# ProbVis: A collection of functions to visualize your data
A collection of functions to visualize results of different types of data. This is an on going project. Check out the `test` folder for examples of usage and the `images` folder for results.

## Getting Started
To install, open a terminal window go to the root folder of the project and run:
```
pip3 install ./
```
To run the tests:
```
python -m unittest -v tests/test_images.py 
```

This is a tentative list of (sooner or later) available distributions: 
* ***Discrete:*** Categorical, Bernoulli, Poisson, ...

* ***Continuous:*** Gaussian, Exponential, Gamma, ... 

* ***Others:*** Mixture of Gaussians, ...
### Categorical
